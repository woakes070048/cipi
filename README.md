## What is Cipi?

Cipi turns any Ubuntu VPS into a **multi-app Laravel hosting platform** — with full isolation, zero-downtime deploys, SSL, queue workers, and S3 backups — all managed from a single CLI.

No web panel. No bloat. No sleepless nights fighting Nginx configs or PHP-FPM pools.  
Just SSH and the `cipi` command.

```bash
$ wget -O - https://cipi.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

> Works on DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Hetzner, Vultr, Linode, OVH, Google Cloud, Scaleway, and more.

---

## From zero to production in 3 steps

**1. Install Cipi** on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04+ VPS (~10 minutes):

```bash
wget -O - https://cipi.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

**2. Create your app** and answer a few prompts:

```bash
cipi app create
# username, domain, git repo, branch, PHP version
# → Cipi sets up everything: user, DB, Nginx, workers, cron
```

**3. Deploy and go live:**

```bash
cipi deploy myapp
cipi ssl install myapp
```

That's it. Your Laravel app is live.

## Stack

Every app gets a fully isolated environment:

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| **Web server** | Nginx reverse proxy with per-app virtual hosts, optimized for Laravel |
| **PHP & Composer** | Selectable per app — PHP 7.4 to 8.5, hot-swappable |
| **Database** | MariaDB, auto-tuned to RAM, dedicated DB and user per app |
| **Queue workers** | Supervisor with per-app pools — add, scale, monitor |
| **Deployments** | Deployer — atomic symlink swap, keeps last 5 releases, instant rollback |
| **SSL** | Let's Encrypt via Certbot with SAN support and auto-renewal |
| **Security** | Fail2ban + UFW, per-app Linux user + PHP-FPM pool + SSH key |
| **Backups** | Automated DB and storage dumps to S3 or any compatible provider |

---

## Features

### 🔒 Security & Isolation by Design
Each app runs under its own Linux user with an isolated filesystem, PHP-FPM pool, and database. A compromise in one app cannot touch the others. Configs are encrypted at rest with AES-256 (Vault). GDPR-compliant log rotation included.

### ⚡ Zero-Downtime Deploys
Deployer clones your repo, runs `composer install`, links storage, runs migrations, and swaps the symlink atomically. Roll back to any of the last 5 releases instantly.

### 🔗 Webhook Auto-Deploy
Native GitHub and GitLab integration — deploy keys and webhooks configured automatically. HMAC signature verification. Or plug in any custom Git provider.

### 🌐 Aliases & SSL
Add multiple domains or subdomains to any app. A single SAN certificate covers all of them. Auto-renew handles the rest.

### 🤖 AI Agent Ready (MCP)
Cipi ships with a built-in MCP server. Install the `cipi-agent` Laravel package, point your AI client at the endpoint, and deploy, rollback, query logs, and run Artisan commands via natural language — no SSH required.

Works with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, OpenAI, Gemini, and more.

```bash
composer require cipi-sh/cipi-agent
```

MCP tools exposed: `health`, `app_info`, `deploy`, `logs`, `db_query`, `artisan`.

### 🔌 REST API (optional)
When you need to manage apps programmatically or integrate with external pipelines, enable the optional API layer with a single command. Bearer tokens, granular permissions, OpenAPI spec available, interactive Swagger docs.

### 🔁 Sync Between Servers
Move entire stacks or single apps between Cipi servers — for migration, failover, or disaster recovery. Archives are encrypted in transit.
